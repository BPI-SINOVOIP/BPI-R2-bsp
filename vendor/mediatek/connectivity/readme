This is an instruction of how to enable MTK wifi module

1. Building linux kernel 
   Please get the source code of linux kernel from branch Wifi_debug_branch of this project, and build it

2. Installing the latest kernel image
   Please install latest kernel image to SD card.
   If you don't know how to do it, please 
   refer to https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-R2-bsp/blob/master/README.md

3. Install WIFI configuration file and firmware to SD card
   1) Install the SD card to host PC
   2) mount /dev/mmcblk01p2 /mnt
   3) You need to create a new folder /mnt/system/etc/firmware/ when you copy configuration filefirst time
   4) Copy the the following files to the folder /mnt/system/etc/firmware/
        config\WMT_SOC.cfg
   5) You need to create a new folder /mnt/etc/firmware when you copy the following files first time
   6) Copy the following files to the folder /mnt/etc/firmware/
        firmware\ROMv2_lm_patch_1_0_hdr.bin 
        firmware\ROMv2_lm_patch_1_1_hdr.bin
        firmware\WIFI_RAM_CODE_7623
   6) Copy the following file to the folder /mnt/etc/firmware/nvram/
        firmware\nvram\WIFI
   7) copy the following utilities to /mnt/usr/bin
        tools\binary\stp_uart_launcher
        tools\binary\wmt_loader
        tools\binary\wmt_loopback
      
     Please note that above utilities are built by the following commands(based on arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc),
     if you need them in other platform, please rebuild them.
        arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc stp_uart_launcher.c -lpthread -o stp_uart_launcher
        arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc wmt_loopback.c -o wmt_loopback
        arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc wmt_loader.c -o wmt_loader

   6) umount the SD card
          umount /mnt

4. Install the SD card to R2 board, and turn it on
5. Run the following commands to enable WIFI module
   1) wmt_loader
   2) stp_uart_launcher -p /etc/firmware &
   3) echo 1 >/dev/wmtWifi

   After completing above commands, we will see a network card wlanX
