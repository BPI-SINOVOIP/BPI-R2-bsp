(Carrier-One was the previous name of Hummingboard).

Building U-boot for Hummingboard
--------------------------------

To build U-Boot for the Hummingboard Solo version:

$ make hummingboard_solo_config
$ make

Flashing U-boot into the SD card
--------------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, the generated 'u-boot.imx' binary must be
flashed into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

(Note - the SD card node may vary, so adjust this as needed).

Also, a more detailed explanation on how to format the SD card is available
at doc/README.imximage.

- Insert the micro SD card into the slot located in the bottom of the board

- Connect a 3.3V USB to serial converter cable to the host PC. The MX6 UART
signals are available in the 26 pin connector as shown at:

(Check for "26 pin header layout").

- Power up the board via USB cable (CON201) and U-boot messages will appear in
the serial console.
