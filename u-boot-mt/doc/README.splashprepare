Splash Screen
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The splash_screen_prepare() function is a weak function defined in
common/splash.c. It is called as part of the splash screen display
sequence. It gives the board an opportunity to prepare the splash
image data before it is processed and sent to the frame buffer by
U-Boot.  Define your own version to use this feature.
